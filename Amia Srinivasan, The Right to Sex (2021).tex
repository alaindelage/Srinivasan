feminism: a political movement, not a theory
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{Feminism} is \textbf{not a philosophy}, or \textbf{a theory}, or even \textbf{a point of view}.\\[1ex] 
	It is \textbf{a political movement to transform the world beyond recognition}. It asks: what would it be to end the political, social, sexual, economic, psychological and physical subordination of women? \textbf{It answers: we do not know; let us try and see}. xi

‘sex’
\begin{quote}
	Feminism begins with \textbf{a woman’s recognition that she is a member of a sex class}: that is, a member of a class of people \textbf{assigned to an inferior social status on the basis of something called ‘sex’} -- \textbf{a thing that is said to be natural, pre-political, an objective material ground on which the world of human culture is built}. xi

‘sex’, this supposedly natural thing -- a cultural thing posing as a natural one
\begin{quote}
	We inspect \textbf{this supposedly natural thing, ‘sex’}, only to find that it is \textbf{already laden with meaning}.\\[1ex] 
	At birth, bodies are sorted as ‘male’ or ‘female’, though many bodies must be mutilated to fit one category or the other, and many bodies will later protest against the decision that was made.\\[1ex] 
	\textbf{This originary division determines what social purpose a body will be assigned}. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex]
	\textbf{Sex} is, then, \textbf{a cultural thing posing as a natural one}. Sex, which feminists have taught us to distinguish from gender, is \textbf{itself already gender in disguise}. xi f.

‘sex’, in another sense: a thing we do with our sexed bodies
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{‘sex’}: sex as \textbf{a thing we do with our sexed bodies}. Some bodies are for other bodies to have sex with. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex] 
	‘Sex’ in this second sense is also \textbf{said to be a natural thing, a thing that exists outside politics}. Feminism shows that \textbf{this too is a fiction}, and a fiction that serves certain interests. Sex, which we think of as the most private of acts, is \textbf{in reality a public thing}. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex]
	the rules for all this were set long before we entered the world xii

feminism ans sexual freedom
\begin{quote}
	Feminists have long dreamed of \textbf{sexual freedom}. What they refuse to accept is \textbf{its simulacrum: sex that is said to be free, not because it is equal, but because it is ubiquitous}. In this world, sexual freedom is \textbf{not a given but something to be achieved}, and it is \textbf{always incomplete}. xii

sex as a political phenomenon -- beyond the narrow parameters of ‘consent’
\begin{quote}
	These essays are \textbf{about the politics and ethics of sex in this world}, animated by a hope of a different world.\\[1ex] 
	They reach back to \textbf{an older feminist tradition that was unafraid to think of sex as a political phenomenon}, as something \textbf{squarely within the bounds of social critique}. The women in this tradition -- from Simone de Beauvoir and Alexandra Kollontai to bell hooks, Audre Lorde, Catharine MacKinnon and Adrienne Rich – dare us to think about the ethics of sex \textbf{beyond the narrow parameters of ‘consent’}. They compel us to ask \textbf{what forces lie behind a woman’s \emph{yes}}; what it reveals about sex that it is something to which consent must be given; how it is that we have come to put so much psychic, cultural and legal weight on a notion of ‘consent’ that cannot support it.\\[1ex] 
	And they ask us to join them in \textbf{dreaming of a freer sex}. xiii

false rape accusation -- and its cultural charge

 false rape accusation, by men
\begin{quote}
	very often, it is men who falsely accuse other men of raping women. This is a thing almost universally misunderstood about false rape accusations. When we think of a false rape accusation we picture a scorned or greedy woman, lying to the authorities. But many, perhaps most, wrongful convictions of rape result from false accusations levied against men by other men 4

false rape accusations as a predominantly wealthy white male preoccupation
\begin{quote}
	It might seem surprising, then, that false rape accusations are, today, a predominantly wealthy white male preoccupation.\\[1ex]
	But it isn’t surprising -- not really. The \textbf{anxiety about false rape accusations} is purportedly about injustice (innocent people being harmed), but \textbf{actually it is about gender, about innocent men being harmed by malignant women}. It is \textbf{an anxiety}, too, \textbf{about race and class}: about \textbf{the possibility that the law might treat wealthy white men as it routinely treats poor black and brown men}.\\1ex 
	For poor men, and women, of colour, the white woman’s false rape accusation is just one element in a matrix of vulnerability to state power.\\[1ex]
	false rape accusations are \textbf{a unique instance of middle-class and wealthy white men’s vulnerability} to the injustices routinely perpetrated by the carceral state against poor people of colour. 5f.

the representation is false -- but, as ideologically efficacious
\begin{quote}
	That representation is, of course, false: even in the case of rape, the state is on the side of wealthy white men.\\[1ex] 
	But what matters in the sense of what is ideologically efficacious -- is not the reality, but the misrepresentation. \textbf{In the false rape accusation, wealthy white men misperceive their vulnerability to women and to the state}. 6

why sex crimes elicit such selective scepticism?
\begin{quote}
	The question, from a feminist perspective, is \textbf{why sex crimes elicit such selective scepticism}.\\[1ex]

intersectionality’s central insight: the danger of a lib movement’s serving the least suppressed members of a group
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{‘Intersectionality’} -- a term coined by \textbf{Kimberlé Crenshaw} to name an idea first articulated by an older generation of feminists from Claudia Jones to Frances M. Beal, the Combahee River Collective, Selma James, Angela Davis, bell hooks, Enriqueta Longeaux y Vásquez and Cherríe Moraga -- is \textbf{often reduced}, in common understanding,\textbf{ to a due consideration of the various axes of oppression and privilege: race, class, sexuality, disability and so on}. But to reduce intersectionality to a mere attention to difference is to forego its power as a theoretical and practical orientation.\\[1ex]
	\textbf{The central insight of intersectionality is that any liberation movement -- feminism, anti-racism, the labour movement -- that focuses only on what all members of the relevant group (women, people of colour, the working class) have in common is a movement that will best serve those members of the group who are least oppressed}. 17

the dilemma of ‘Believe women’
\begin{quote}
	When we are too quick to believe a white woman’s accusation against a black man, or a Brahmin woman’s accusation against a Dalit man, it is black and Dalit women who are rendered more vulnerable to sexual violence. Their ability to speak out against the violence they face from men of their race or caste is stifled, and their status as counterpart to the oversexed black or Dalit male is entrenched. In that paradox of female sexuality, such women are rendered unrapeable, and thus more rapeable. 18

\#Metoo, or, the rules changed suddenly
\begin{quote}
	This idea -- that the rules have suddenly changed on men, so that they now face punishment for behaviour that was once routinely permitted -- has become a \#MeToo commonplace. 20\\[1ex]
	\#MeToo is often seen as having produced a generalised version of the situation in which John Cogan found himself. Patriarchy has lied to men about what is and is not OK, in sex and in gender relations as a whole. Men are now being caught out and unfairly punished for their innocent mistakes, as women enforce a new set of rules. Perhaps these new rules are the correct ones; and, doubtless, the old ones caused a lot of harm. But how were men to have known any better? In their minds they weren’t guilty, so don’t they too have grounds for acquittal? 21

	And yet, if the aim is not merely to punish male sexual domination but to end it, feminism must address questions that many feminists would rather avoid: whether a carceral approach that systemically harms poor people and people of colour can serve sexual justice; whether the notion of due process -- and perhaps too the presumption of innocence -- should apply to social media and public accusations; whether punishment produces social change.\\[1ex]

Kwadwo Bonsu, University of Massachusetts, 2014 case (24ff.) -- an expectation already internalised
\begin{quote}
	She kept going for the reason that so many girls and women keep going: because women who sexually excite men are supposed to finish the job. It doesn’t matter whether Bonsu himself had this expectation, because it is \textbf{an expectation already internalised by many women}. A woman going on with a sex act she no longer wants to perform, knowing she can get up and walk away but knowing at the same time that this will make her \textbf{a blue-balling tease}, an object of male contempt: \textbf{there is more going on here than mere ambivalence, unpleasantness and regret}. 27f.

a kind of coercion, by the informal regulatory system of gendered sexual expectations
\begin{quote}
	There is also \textbf{a kind of coercion}: not directly by Bonsu, perhaps, but \textbf{by the informal regulatory system of gendered sexual expectations}. Sometimes the price for violating these expectations is steep, even fatal.\\[1ex] 
	That is why there is a connection between these episodes of ‘ordinary’ sex and the ‘actual wrongs and harms’ of sexual assault. What happened at UMass may well be ‘ordinary’ in the statistical sense -- as in what happens every day -- but it isn’t ‘ordinary’ in the ethical sense, as in what we should pass over without comment. In that sense it is \textbf{an extraordinary phenomenon with which we are all too familiar}. 28

the mainstream pornographers’ right to express their viewpoint
\begin{quote}
	A similar argument was mobilised by judges and legal scholars against the Dworkin-MacKinnon anti-porn ordinances. The legislation, they argued, violated the right of mainstream pornographers to express their viewpoint that women were objects for the sexual use of men.\\[1ex] 
	Since the Dworkin-MacKinnon ordinances did not target all pornographic material, but only pornographic material that subordinated women by presenting them as dehumanised sexual objects, it discriminated on the basis of content rather than form. In the debate between misogynists and feminists over women’s equality, the state couldn’t take sides.

MacKinnon’s rebuttal
\begin{quote}
	First, porn’s ‘contribution’ to the debate about women’s status precludes the possibility of women’s entering the debate on equal terms. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex]
	The exercise of pornographers’ right to free speech undermines women’s own right to free speech. 53\\[1ex]
	Second, MacKinnon argued, pornography doesn’t merely express the view that women are to be subordinated --- it is not ‘only words’. By training our attention on porn and its worldly effects, we can come to see it as \textbf{an act of subordination, whose function is to enforce the second-class status of all women in relation to men}. The very fact that judges, lawyers and philosophers insist on \textbf{treating porn as a question of free speech --- as a question of what porn says rather than what it does ---} betrays their implicitly male perspective, their failure to see porn as many women see it. 54

‘free speech’ as an ideological tool --- the distinction speech v/ action
\begin{quote}
	\textbf{‘Free speech’}, which poses as a merely formal principle of adjudication, is in fact, MacKinnon suggests, \textbf{an ideological tool} selectively deployed to protect the freedoms of the dominant class.\\[1ex] 
	(This is something that the feminist philosophers who have sought to elaborate and defend MacKinnon’s argument generally miss: \textbf{the issue, for MacKinnon, is not that pornography really is, metaphysically speaking, an action rather than mere speech, but that the very distinction between speech and action is political all the way down}.) 54

feminism x the state x the New Right
\begin{quote}
	The early feminist campaigns against porn in the 1960s took direct action against the makers and sellers of porn in the form of boycotts and protests. By contrast, the antiporn campaigners of the early 1980s called on the power of the state. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex]
	Should it have come as a surprise when the state, under the cover of feminism, acted to further the subordination of women and sexual minorities?\par
	This question had a particular significance in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when the US anti-porn feminists were campaigning.\\[1ex] 
	The decision of the US Supreme Court in \emph{Roe v. Wade} (1973) to legalise abortion represented a significant victory for feminism,\\[1ex] 
	but also led to an organised right-wing backlash which united, to determining and lasting effect, religious conservatives with proponents of neoliberal economics.\\[1ex] 
	Central to the New Right’s ideological programme was a reversal of feminist achievements: not just the legalisation of abortion, but also the availability of contraception and birth control, sex education, gay and lesbian rights, and women’s mass entry into the workforce.\\[1ex] 
	In this climate, radical feminist critiques of pornography dovetailed with a conservative ideology which made a distinction between ‘bad’ women (sex workers, ‘welfare queens’) who must be disciplined by the state and ‘good’ women who needed its protection, and which saw men as naturally rapacious and in need of taming by the institutions of monogamous marriage and the nuclear family. [\dots\hspace{-0.3ex}]\\[1ex]
	It was Ronald Reagan, the lodestar of the New Right, who as president ordered his attorney general to conduct an investigation into the harms of pornography, to which MacKinnon and Dworkin gave expert testimony. 55f.

mainstream porn, the pleasures of ego-identification
\begin{quote}
	Except that, in reality, there is no pornworld and no window onto it, and there is nothing incidental about the pleasures we take from porn. \textbf{Porn is an elaborate construction designed to get the viewer off}. That the sex in it might be real, and that the pleasure sometimes is too, doesn’t change this.\\[1ex] 
	Obviously, mainstream porn offers \textbf{the pleasures of looking at the woman’s body on display}, its orifices, one by one, awaiting penetration: mouth, vagina, anus.\\[1ex] 
	But, more than this, it offers \textbf{the pleasures of ego-identification}. For mainstream porn depicts a very particular kind of sexual schema in which, on the whole, women are hungry for the assertion of male sexual power --- and then assigns to the viewer a particular focus of identification within it. \textbf{64f.}
